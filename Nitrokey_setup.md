# Nitrokey instructions 

## Determing which nitrokey is which 

- Install the opensc package (debian):
```
sudo apt-get install opensc
```

- Start the pcsc deamon:
```
pcscd
```

- List the nitrokeys:
```
pkcs11-tool --list-slots
```

## Resetting nitrokey back to factory settings

- Change identity to 0:

```
gpg-connect-agent --hex "scd apdu  00 85 00 00" /bye
```

- Restore communication to the card:

```
gpg --card-status
```

- Confirm the change to identity by locating the 10th byte of the application ID, it should be FE:
```

- Restore communication to the card:

```
gpg --card-status
```

- Confirm the change to identity by locating the 10th byte of the application ID, it should be 01:

```

- Restore communication to the card:

```
gpg --card-status
```

- Confirm the change to identity by locating the 10th byte of the application ID, it should be 02:

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.
